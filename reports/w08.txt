Notes week 8

What I did this week:
Checked computation from last week, discussed it with friends, found (conceptual) error
Proved two results (one is a stronger version of the other)
Implemented regularization based on proof. Very slow; possible approach is batching?
Made it possible to visualize adjoint (there were bugs earlier)
Visualized some adjoints, more on this next week
Worked a bit on integration vs. no integration and adjoint, found heuristic reasoning why integration works better

Questions:
In the proof I assume differentiability. What about ReLU (which is piecewise linear)?
Publication?
Should implement more/make more theory, or should I focus on finishing up now?
Good ways to illustrate code performance? - Look at other papers (and NFE, Norm of adjoint, state norm, acc.)

Other ideas I had this week (probably no time to look into, maybe next project?):
Proof does not guarantee that e.g. AntiSymmetricRNN has stable adjoint. Are there adversarial attacks to destabilize adjoint?
E.g. if we take a AD a^T, can choose entries of D s.t. Da^T = (Aa^T)^T to make adjoint behavior as bad as possible. Can we use this as an attack?

Report:
Collect ideas, put them in relation to each other
Illustrate how the methods I have implemented (PDEFunc, regularization) affect the adjoint, compare with other methods (and Residual RNNs?)

Next week:
Think about theoretical results using ReLU (not diffable)
Work on collecting results for report (NFE, adjoint behavior, benchmarks)
Make writeup less chaotic
Clean up code (e.g. implement abstract class ModuleWithParams ...)
Run more tests for report (make a systematic way to run tests)
