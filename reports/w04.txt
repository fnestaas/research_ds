Notes week 4

This week I finished all of the todos of last week

Some current issues are that computing the time derivative of the gradient of the loss wrt the parameters is very slow, and that it is hard to verify whether the computations are actually doing what I want them to. 

While I have logged into Euler, I have yet to try running this code there, but my guess is that it is still too show to make a loss function out of it

Next week:
Try to improve runtime mentioned above
If feasible, implement regularization to prevent large gradient fluctuations
Work on novel approaches to the problem, potentially also other ways to compute the gradient fluctuations (due to runtime concerns)
