What I did this week

Read paper on neural CDE, but did not implement it. Wanted to ask about feasibility since we would be doing another matrix-vector mutliplication
(f_\theta @ dX/ds)

Found out that MNIST is not a good test, results essentially rely on linear layer

Saw that there are distributional differences when predicting matrices and predicting the output directly

Checked Frobenius norms of derivatives

Next week:
think about distributions, initialization schemes. Use flax?
Idea: learn how to initialize these networks. 

Write report
