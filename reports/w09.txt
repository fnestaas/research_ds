Notes Week 9

What I did this week:
Prepared presentation
Made tests easily runnable
Compared different final acitvations, integrating vs not integrating
Thought about symmetric part of jacobian; if we integrate, then the symmetric part S satisfies x^T S x = 0 for all x
Worked on report;
simplified proofs
Made report more complete
Wrote some examples

Next week:

change presentation; 
Some normalization in the plots of the adjoint norm? E.g. max(norm)/min(norm) or quantiles
Idea: add a slide on which metrics make sense BEFORE showing the plots
Change "sample adjoint" to "... norm", also label axes
Also clearify we are seeing exploding gradients in the plot
Try different random seeds - especially B(x) vs A(sx), plot uncertainties

Hold presentation
Think about difference between integrating/not integrating to get f_\theta(z, t)
