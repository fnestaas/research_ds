Notes Week 9

Questions:
Weird adjoint behavior. If I use automatic differentiation, I get much lower variance than if I compute the gradients myself, even though performance is similar.
TODO: Maybe the gradient computation I make is bad somehow? I don't think it should matter too much for the adjoint though.
