Notes week 12

What I did this week
Implemented own test on 15 dim example, can match performance of RegularFunc
Experimented with NeuralCDE but I think it would require quite a bit of work and be very slow
Worked on the report

Observed that Kidger was not careful about initializing NNs for matrices in his NeuralCDE - potential improvement?
He also uses tanh at the end which might ensure that the ODEs are not too stiff
