Notes week 3
Surprisingly, training on only the first 10% with 10 nodes and 2 layers gives better results
for gatedode. Also requires fewer steps to get better results (200, 200 instead of 500, 400)

There is a really strange structure in nfe.pkl. Idk why really

This week
Restructured classes of NeuralODE (see WeightDynamics)
Did swish
Did NFE
Did (most of) state norm analysis (toy examples done) 
Did look at adjoints in diffrax, but it seems this cannot be called directly -> make classes
Did not have time to implement the above since it took a while to understand how to 
go about solving it


Want to do next week:
Finish implementing the above to work well with NeuralODEs
