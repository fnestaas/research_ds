Notes Week 10

This week:
Ideas:
held presentation; got valuable feedback
- look at batch norm
- show for bigger examples
To do this, I should make sure the ODEs are easy to learn (see Duvenaud paper)
Otherwise, maybe just implement this as a ResNet? 
I could also analyze other architectures from the view of NODEs (there are papers that translate architectures)

What I did:
Made MNIST and CIFAR tests work, did some tests
Analyzed expected values of symmetric parts of jacobians

Next week:
Problem with dt0 in NeuralODE.solve
Run tests again, properly
Run tests on different datasets
Work on report
Kidger Controlled DE https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08926 Read paper and use datasets
